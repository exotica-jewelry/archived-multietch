      <description>I originally perfected Multi-Etch® for titanium production. It’s a nonacid (pH 6.8) alternative to hydrofluoric acid. I’ve also tested it on other metals with great results.
You can use Multi-Etch® for etching brass; the brass will etch more quickly than titanium.</description>

I have used Multi-Etch® to remove broken steel drill bits trapped in titanium and gold. You can use Multi-Etch® to remove light firescale from silver, but not from gold.</description>

Multi-Etch® will enhance the patterns in mokume and the crystals in meteorites by etching the different metals at different rates, thus slightly raising one over another.
Here is some meteorite showing before and after treatment with Multi-Etch®:

On niobium, I use Multi-Etch® to remove anodizing mistakes and to clean off contamination—iron from rolling mills, heat oxides, etc. Multi-Etch® will maintain the finish on niobium as long as the metal is not etched too long.</description>

You can clean iron contamination from platinum without removing any platinum ions. I’ve done limited testing with Multi-Etch® on platinum for etch effects—that is, removal of platinum ions—and there doesn’t seem to be any effect.
I manufacture a line of titanium wedding rings with platinum inlays.</description>

I have not tested Multi-Etch® with rhodium plating, but I have used it to clean iron contamination from platinum without removing any platinum ions. I believe there would be a similar effect with rhodium.</description>
