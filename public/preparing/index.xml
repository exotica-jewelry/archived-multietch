      <description>How much to use and how long to etch will, of course, vary depending on what metal you use and what effect you’re after. Below are two examples.
Example 1: For a production run of 50 titanium parts, approximately one square inch each, I use one cup of Multi-Etch® in a two-cup Pyrex® container, heated to about 150° F. You can use a thermometer or look for the built in Multi-Etch® bubbles which tell you when it’s ready to use (visual check.</description>

      <description>When welding titanium components that need to withstand the rigors of deep space and deep water, it is critical to have absolutely clean titanium and that is what Multi-Etch® will provide.
Double strength is recommended for etching at room temperature; heated solution works faster.
When using Multi-Etch® at room temperature, dip your pieces for 90 seconds and rinse thoroughly; for complex surfaces ultrasonic cleaning is recommended to remove any residual Multi-Etch®.</description>
