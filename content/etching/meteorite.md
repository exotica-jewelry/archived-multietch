title: "Etching meteorite with Multi-Etch®"
---

**I originally perfected Multi-Etch® for titanium production. It’s a nonacid (pH 6.8) alternative to hydrofluoric acid. I’ve also tested it on other metals with great results.**

Multi-Etch® will enhance the patterns in mokume and the crystals in **meteorites** by etching the different metals at different rates, thus slightly raising one over another.

Here is some meteorite showing before and after treatment with Multi-Etch®:
