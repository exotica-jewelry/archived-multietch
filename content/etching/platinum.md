title: "Etching platinum with Multi-Etch®"
---

**I originally perfected Multi-Etch® for titanium production. It’s a nonacid (pH 6.8) alternative to hydrofluoric acid. I’ve also tested it on other metals with great results.**

You can clean iron contamination from **platinum** without removing any platinum ions. I’ve done limited testing with Multi-Etch® on platinum for etch effects—that is, removal of platinum ions—and there doesn’t seem to be any effect.

I manufacture a line of [titanium wedding rings](https://www.titaniumringsforever.com) with platinum inlays. As all platinum fabricators are aware, the accepted method to remove cross-contamination prior to welding or soldering is a 15 minute soak in nitric acid or bisodium sulfate. With Multi-Etch®, a 15-second dip is sufficient to eliminate all impurities that could interfere with a perfect weld or solder joint. I dangle the platinum from a niobium wire into the Multi-Etch® for 15 seconds and then rinse in distilled water. It’s now ready for a perfect weld.
