title: "Etching brass with Multi-Etch®"
---

**I originally perfected Multi-Etch® for titanium production. It’s a nonacid (pH 6.8) alternative to hydrofluoric acid. I’ve also tested it on other metals with great results.**

You can use Multi-Etch® for etching **brass**; the brass will etch more quickly than titanium.
