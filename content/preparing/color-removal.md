## Titanium: Heated, regular-strength Multi-Etch®

Dip pieces for 30–60 seconds. High-voltage colors take longer.

## Titanium: Room-temperature, double-strength Multi-Etch®

Dip pieces for 6–8 minutes.

## Niobium

Removing color from niobium takes considerably longer than titanium, up to 30 minutes in heated Multi-Etch® to remove high-voltage colors.
