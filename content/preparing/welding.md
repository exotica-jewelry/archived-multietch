title: "Welding with Multi-Etch®"
---

When welding titanium components that need to withstand the rigors of deep space and deep water, it is critical to have absolutely clean titanium and that is what Multi-Etch® will provide.

Double strength is recommended for etching at room temperature; heated solution works faster.

When using Multi-Etch® at room temperature, dip your pieces for 90 seconds and rinse thoroughly; ultrasonic cleaning is recommended.

When using regular strength Multi-Etch®, heat to 150ºF, dip for 7 seconds and rinse thoroughly; ultrasonic cleaning is advisable.
